# Deep Twitter Q&A

## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to know how someone special would reply on Twitter? Train a model on their twitter data. Here we are using realdonaldtrump

This repository has adapted [Conchylicultor/DeepQA](https://github.com/Conchylicultor/DeepQA) to specifically ONLY work with tweets.
Note that by default scraping Twitter and using their API will only yield you a maximum of 3200 tweets; most likely less.
Twitter data will be collected by using the Twitter API. More specifically, all the answers of the person of interest in respond to questions is what the model will be trained on.


If there are companies out there who would like to have a custom QA application, feel free to contact me.

## Usage

Fill in twitter credentials in `chatbot/credentials.json`.

Then you can run:

    python main.py --twitter_name gvanrossum

to build a model after the BDFL.

... 20 minutes later ...

Run

    python main.py --twitter_name gvanrossum --test interactive

to have an interactive QA session with Guido.


## Installation (quoting Conchylicultor)

The program requires the following dependencies (easy to install using pip):
 * python 3.5
 * tensorflow (tested with v0.9.0 and v0.11.0)
 * numpy
 * CUDA (for using gpu, see TensorFlow [installation page](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html#optional-install-cuda-gpus-on-linux) for more details)
 * nltk (natural language toolkit for tokenized the sentences)
 * tqdm (for the nice progression bars)
